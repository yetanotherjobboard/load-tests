Migration from fly.io to gcp/cloudrun in progress, so testing both.

#### system under test:
- platform: fly.io
    - specs same as before
- platform: gcp/cloudrun
    - search service spec: same as in fly.io
    - postgres spec:
        - less RAM than on fly.io (~0.6GB)

#### test setup:

- previous setup was too challenging for CloudRun (would take few hours to finish)
- introduced pause between each search request (1-2 seconds, 'user thinking time')
- dropped down to 17 000 search requests in total, divided in 3 phases with varying number of concurrent users:
    - warmup: 500 requests, 10 users
    - load: 1500 requests, 30 users
    - soak: 15 000 requests, 100 users

``` java
    var warmUp = searchLoop("warm up", 10)
        .injectOpen(rampUsers(10).during(10));

    var load = searchLoop("load", 10)
        .injectOpen(rampUsers(30).during(15));

    var soak = searchLoop("soak", 30)
        .injectOpen(rampUsers(100).during(100));

    var traffic = warmUp.andThen(load).andThen(soak);
```

#### test results for warmup + load (no soak):

- fly details: <a href="gatling/2023.05.18-searchload-fly">[fly gatling report]</a>
- gcp details: <a href="gatling/2023.05.18-searchload-gcp">[gcp gatling report]</a>
- summary:
  - results are very similar for both platforms, and really good
  - execution time : 3.5 minutes
  - mean response time: 0.3 sec
  - average req/sec: 7 in warmup, 15 in load phase

#### test results for warmup + load + soak:

- fly:
  - details: <a href="gatling/2023.05.18-searchload-soak-fly">[fly gatling report]</a>
  - summary:
    - execution time : 10 minutes
    - mean response time: 0.3 sec
    - average req/sec in soak phase: 55
- gcp/cloudrun
  - details: <a href="gatling/2023.05.18-searchload-soak-gcp">[gcp gatling report]</a>
  - summary:
    - system overloaded, huge latencies
    - execution time : 40 minutes
    - mean response time in soak phase: 13.5 sec
    - average req/sec in soak phase: ~5

### conclusions

- cloudrun is throttling the traffic once it considers it excessive
- possibly some kind of DoS protection
- need to confirm if throttling occurs only if traffic is from a single IP
